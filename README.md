**Answer 2:** 

### 📋 Given Data

| Parameter                                | Value  | Unit    |
|-----------------------------------------:|:------:|:-------:|
| Total design load on landing and flight/going | 10     | kN/m²  |
| Landing X Dimension                      | 0.45   | m       |
| Landing Y Dimension                      | 0.60   | m       |
| Going (G)                                | 2.50   | m       |
| Clear Width of staircase                             | 2.40   | m       |
| Brick Wall Thickness                     | 250    | mm      |

#### Step 1: Determine Effective depth (Refer Clause 23.21 (a) for simply supported beam, IS 456 : 2000)
Calculation
```
centre to centre distance between landings = X+G+Y = 0.45+2.5+0.6 = 3.55m=3550 mm
Thickness of slab = 3550/20 = 177.5~180 mm
Assume dia. of bar 12 mm and clear cover 20 mm (mild exposure condition), the effective depth(d)= 180-20-12/2 = 154 mm
```
#### Step 2: Determine Effective Span (Refer Clause 22.2 (a), IS 456 : 2000)
The effective span is calculated as the sum of the going and the two landing dimensions.

Formula:
```
Effective Span :
1. Leff. = Clear Width + effective depth
2. Leff. = Clear Width + support width/2 + support width/2
```
Calculation:
```
1. Leff. = 2.4 + 0.154 = 2.554m
2. Leff. = 2.4 + 0.25/2 + 0.25/2 = 2.65 m
```
##### ✅ Effective span
```
Consider effective span which is lesser in the above value
Effective span of landing slab, Leff. = 2.554 m
```
#### Step 3: Calculate Loads acting on landing (assumed to be uniformly distributed)

**A. Load Intensity**
```
- Load on Going: Design load on flight/going x G/2 = 10 x 2.5/2 = 12.5 kN/m
- Load on Landing  = 10 kN/m
```

**B. Total Load:**
```
Total Load = 10 + 12.5 = 22.5 kN/m
```

**C. Load on  1 meter strip**
```
w = 22.5/ 1.2m = 18.75 kN/m
```
### Step 4: Calculate Maximum Bending Moment
For a simply supported beam with uniformly distributed load, the maximum bending moment at midspan is:
```
Mu = w × leff.² / 8
```

Calculation:
```
w = 18.75 kN/m
leff. = 2.554 m
```
```
Mu = 18.75 × (2.554)² / 8
   = 18.75 × 6.523 / 8
Mu = 15.288 ~ 15.3 kNm
```
---

### ✅ Final Result
```
The design maximum bending moment at midspan of the landing is: 

Mu = 15.3 kNm
```

**Ques 3.** Design stairs consisting of independent steps project from the face of RCC wall. The stairs will be part of a mall be constructed in Goa.

**Answer 3:** 

### Assumptions
- Width of flight = 1.5 m  
- Riser = 150 mm  
- Tread = 300 mm  
- Grade of concrete = M20, fck = 20 N/mm²  
- Grade of steel = Fe 415, fy = 415 N/mm²

### Solution

- It is desirable to make the actual width of the tread slab, B, about 10 mm more than the effective tread, so that there is a marginal overlap between adjacent tread slabs.  
  - B = 310 mm

- Assume a slab thickness at the fixed support, t = 150 mm.  
  - The slab thickness may be kept constant for a distance of, say, 300 mm from the support and tapered to a minimum thickness of 80 mm (as shown in the referenced figure).

#### 1. Design loads

##### 1.1 Dead loads
(1) Self weight of tread slab = 25 × (0.15 × 0.31) = 1.162 kN/m

(2) Finishes = 0.6 × 0.31 = 0.186 kN/m

Total dead load, DL = 1.162 + 0.186 = 1.348 kN/m

$$Wu_{DL}$$ = 1.348 × 1.5 = 2.022 kN/m


##### 1.2 Live load
(i) Alternative I:

$$Wu_{LL}$$ = 5.0 × 0.3 × 1.5 = 2.250 kN/m

(ii) Alternative II:

$$Wu_{LL}$$ = 1.3 × 1.5 = 1.95 kN/m (at free end)

#### 2. Design Moments

- Moment at fixed end due to dead load:

$$Mu_{DL} = \frac{(2.022 × 1.5²)}{2}$$ = 2.27 kNm

- Moments due to live load (considering alternatives):

$$Mu_{LL} (Alt I) = \frac{(2.25 × 1.5²)}{2}$$ = 2.53 kNm

$$Mu_{LL}$$ (Alt II) = 1.95 × 1.5 = 2.93 kNm  (more critical)
  
-Total design bending moment at fixed end:

Mu = $$Mu_{DL} + Mu_{LL}$$ = 2.27 + 2.93 = 5.20 kNm


#### 3. Design of Main Bars

Assume clear cover = 20 mm **(mild exposure)** and bar diameter = 10 mm.  
**Effective depth:**

d = 150 - 20 - $$\frac{10}{2}$$ = 125 mm

**Required main steel area (Ast) using the following expression:**

$Ast_{req} = \frac{0.5·f_{ck}}{f_y}·[1 − √\frac{1 − (4.6 · Mu)}{f_ck·bd²}].bd$

 = $$\frac{0.5·20}{415}·[1 − √\frac{1 − (4.6 · 5.2 x 10^6)}{20·310.125²}].310.125$$

$$Ast_{req}$$= 123.37 mm² ~ 124 mm²

Provide main bars of 10 mm dia.

Area of one 10Φ = $$\frac{π}{4}$$ × 10² = 78.54 mm²

No. of bars = $$\frac{Ast_{req}}{Area of one 10Φ} = \frac{124}{78.54}$$ = 3 No.

$$A_{st provided}$$ = 3 × 78.54 = 235.62 mm²  ~ 124 mm²

#### 4. Design of Distribution Bars

**Minimum steel for distribution bars:**

$$A_{st,min}$$ = 0.12% × b × d = 0.12% × 310 × 125 = 180 mm²

Provide 8 mm bar:

Area of one 8Φ = π/4 × 8² = 50.27 mm²  (approx)

**Spacing** = $$\frac{Area of one 8Φ}{A_{st,min}}$$ x 1000
            = $$\frac{50.27 mm²}{180}$$ x 1000  = 278.88 mm

**Provide distribution bars 8 mm Φ @ 270 mm c/c**

#### 5. Summary / Provided reinforcement
**Main reinforcement: 3 nos. 10 mm Ø bars (Ast provided = 235.6 mm²)**

**Distribution bars: 8 mm Ø @ 270 mm c/c**

<img width="1242" height="396" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b23de724-5717-4adc-a532-906ba0718b40" />

**Ques 4:** Find design shear forces and bending moments(as per IS 456) at critical sections of a five-span continuous reinforced beam supported on masonry supports of 300 mm each.  
Clear spans from left to right: 4.5 m, 4.75 m, 5.0 m, 4.75 m, 4.5 m. Beam is subjected to dead load (including self weight) of 60 kN/m and imposed (live) load of 30 kN/m at service level.

<img width="810" height="252" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/525c9de1-a2b2-4470-88d0-5b593c2c9492" />

**Answer 4:**
### Given data

- Clear spans (left → right): 4.5 m, 4.75 m, 5.0 m, 4.75 m, 4.5 m  
- Support width (masonry): 300 mm = 0.30 m  
- Dead load (service): 60 kN/m (incl. self weight)  
- Imposed (live) load (service): 30 kN/m

### Solution

#### **1. Design (factored) uniformly distributed loads (using 1.5 load factor)**

$$Wu_{DL}$$ = 60 × 1.5 = 90 kN/m

$$Wu_{LL}$$ = 30 × 1.5 = 45 kN/m


Total factored UDL (where needed) = 90 + 45 = 135 kN/m

#### **2. Effective spans (clear span + support width)**

(Use support width = 0.30 m added to the clear span at the relevant span as we don't know about effective depth)

For 4.5 m span: 4.5 + 0.3 = 4.8 m
For 4.75 m span: 4.75 + 0.3 = 5.05 m
For 5.0 m span: 5.0 + 0.3 = 5.3 m

#### **3. Shear Forces**
**Use Formula**

SF = $$(Coeff.Wu_{DL} + Coeff.Wu_{LL}) x l$$

For Example : ((0.4 × Wu_DL) + (0.45 × Wu_LL)) × 4.8

**1. At end supports (SF1)**

SF1 = ((0.4 × 90) + (0.45 × 45)) × 4.8 = 270 kN

**2. At supports next to the end supports**

**2.1 Outer side (SF2)**

SF2 = ((0.5 × 90) + (0.6 × 45)) × 4.8 = 388.8 kN

**2.2 Inner side (SF3)**

SF3 = ((0.55 × 90) + (0.6 × 45)) × 5.05 = 386.325 kN

**3. At all other interior supports (SF4)**

SF4 = ((0.5 × 90) + (0.6 × 45)) × 5.3 = 381.6 kN

#### 4. Bending Moments
**Formula used**

Mu = $$(Coeff.Wu_{DL} + Wu_{LL}) × l^2$$ 

##### **1. Span moments** 

**1.1 Near middle of end span**

M1 = $$(\frac{Wu_{DL}}{12} + \frac{Wu_{LL}}{10}) × l^2$$  = $$(\frac{90}{12} + \frac{45}{10}) × 4.8^2$$ = 276.48 kNm

**1.2 At middle of interior span**

M2 = $$(\frac{Wu_{DL}}{16} + \frac{Wu_{LL}}{12}) × l^2$$  = $$(\frac{90}{16} + \frac{45}{12}) × 5.05^2$$ = 239.1 kNm

M3 = $$(\frac{Wu_{DL}}{16} + \frac{Wu_{LL}}{12}) × l^2$$  = $$(\frac{90}{16} + \frac{45}{12}) × 5.3^2$$ = 263.34 kNm

##### **1. Span moments** 

**At support next to the end supports**

M4 = $$- (\frac{Wu_{DL}}{10} + \frac{Wu_{LL}}{9}) × l^2$$  = $$- (\frac{90}{10} + \frac{45}{9}) × 4.8^2$$ = -322.56 kNm

**At support next to the end supports**

M5 = $$- (\frac{Wu_{DL}}{12} + \frac{Wu_{LL}}{9}) × l^2$$  = $$- (\frac{90}{12} + \frac{45}{9}) × 5.3^2$$ = -351.125 kNm

**Ques 5:** — Design of 2nd span of continuous beam of **question 4**.

### Given
- Clear span (2nd span): 4.75 m  
- Support width: 0.30 m  
- Effective span, l = 4.75 + 0.30 = 5.05 m  
- Assumed overall dimensions: b = 300 mm, d = 500 mm  
- Provided bar considered: 25 mm Ø (area of one 25 mm bar = 490.87 mm²)  
- Material properties and moments are used as given in the problem statements below.

### Solution

#### **1. Calculation of steel required at mid-span ( as given)**

Formula used (as given):

$$Ast_{req} = \frac{0.5·f_{ck}}{f_y}·[1 − √\frac{1 − (4.6 · Mu)}{f_{ck}·bd²}].bd$$

Using the provided numeric substitution:
- Mu (given) = 239.1 × 10^6 N·mm  
- fck = 35 MPa (as used in the mid-span calculation)  
- fy = 415 MPa  
- b = 300 mm  
- d = 500 mm

$$Ast_{req} = \frac{0.5·35}{415}·[1 − √\frac{1 − (4.6 · 239.1 × 10^6)}{35·300.500²}].300.500$$

$$Ast_{req}$$ = 1613.1 mm²

Provide 25 mm Φ bars:
- Area of one 25 mm Φ = π × 25² / 4 = 490.87 mm²  
- Number of bars = 1613.1 / 490.87 = 3.28 → provide 4 bars  
- $$Ast_{provided}$$ = 4 × 490.87 = 1963.48 mm²

#### **2. Support reinforcement $$(A_{st})$$ — calculation and bar selection**

Using the given values:
- Mu (support) = 351.25 × $$10^6$$ N·mm  
- fck = 25 MPa  
- fy = 415 MPa  
- b = 300 mm  
- d = 500 mm

Substituting values:

$$Ast_{req} = \frac{0.5·f_{ck}}{f_y}·[1 − √\frac{1 − (4.6 · Mu)}{f_{ck}·bd²}].bd$$

  $$= \frac{0.5·25}{415}·[1 − √\frac{1 − (4.6 · 351.25 × 10^6)}{415·300.500²}].300.500 = 1646.63 mm^2$$

$$Ast_{req} at support = 1646.63 mm^2$$

Provide 25 mm Φ bars:
- Area of one 25 mm Φ = π × 25² / 4 = 490.87 mm²  
- No. of bars = $$\frac{Ast_{req}}{Area of one 10Φ} = \frac{1646.63}{490.87}$$ = 4 No.

#### **3. Reinforcement Summary**

**Provide 4-25 mm Φ bars at mid span out of which middle 2 bars are cut bars from distance of $0.15l_2$ from centre of the support**

**Provide 4-25 mm Φ bars at top of support out of which middle 2 bars are cut bars from distance of $0.3l_2$ from face of the support**

Use 10mm φ bar

Eff. depth of slab

$$d_x$$ = D-c-φ/2 = 200-20-10/2 = 175mm

$$d_y$$ = D-20-φ-φ/2 = 200-20-12-12/2 = 162mm

Grade of conc. = M25

Steel = Fe 415

#### 2. Design Loads

Design load Dead load = 25 x 0.2 = 5 kN/m²

live load = 3 kN/m²
```
Factored (design) load = 1.5 (DL + LL) = 1.5 x (5 + 3) = 12kN/m^2
```

#### 3. Eff span
$$l_x$$ (Shorter span)

$$l_x$$ = 4.25 + 0.174 = 4.424m

$$l_x$$ = 4.25 + 0.23 = 4.48m

Take lower value of the above **lx = 4.424m**

$$l_y$$ (Longer span)

$$l_y$$ = 5.5 + 0.162 = 5.662m

$$l_y$$ = 5.5 + 0.23 = 5.73m

Take lower value of the above **$$l_y$$  = 5.662m**

### 4. Calculation of Moment and steel
