Quest 1: What clear cover be provided for a beam which is part of a bridge deck to be constructed over the Arabian Sea, along the western cost of Mumbai.

Answer 1. Provide 45mm clear cover considering severe express condition - concrete exposed to coastal environment

Ques 2: Analysis for the maximum BM to be considered for the design of the landing slab of a staircase shown in the figure, taking total design lead on landing and flight as 10 KN/m², X = 0.45m, Y = 0.6m & G=2.5m. Clear width of staircase is 2.4m and brick walls supporting Staircase have thickness of 250m.

Answer 2. 

### Given Data
- Total design load on landing and flight/going kit = **10 kN/m²**
- X = **0.45 m**
- Y = **0.6 m**
- G = **2.5 m**
- Clear width = **2.4 m**
- Brick wall thickness = **250 mm**
- Effective span = **G + X + Y = 2.5 + 0.45 + 0.6 = 3.55 m**

---

### Solution

- **Load on Going** = 10 kN/m²  
- **Load on Landing** → 50% of the load may be assumed to act horizontally  
  → \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \, \text{kN/m²} \)

#### Loads:
1. Directly on landing:  
   \( 10 \times (0.6 + 0.45) = 10.5 \, \text{kN/m} \)

2. From going:  
   \( 10 \times \frac{2.5}{2} = 12.5 \, \text{kN/m} \)

- **Total Load** = \( 10.5 + 12.5 = 23 \, \text{kN/m} \)

- **Loading on 1 m wide strip**:  
  \( \frac{23}{2.4} = 9.58 \, \text{kN/m} \)

---

### Effective Span
- \( (2.4 \times 2) + 0.1 = 4.9 \, \text{m} \)

---

### Design Maximum Bending Moment at Midspan of Landing
- \( M_u = \frac{w l^2}{8} = \frac{9.58 \times 4.9^2}{8} = 28.75 \, \text{kNm} \)
