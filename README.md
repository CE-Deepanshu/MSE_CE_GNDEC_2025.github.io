Quest 1: What clear cover be provided for a beam which is part of a bridge deck to be constructed over the Arabian Sea, along the western cost of Mumbai.

Answer 1. Provide 45mm clear cover considering severe express condition - concrete exposed to coastal environment

Ques 2: Analysis for the maximum BM to be considered for the design of the landing slab of a staircase shown in the figure, taking total design lead on landing and flight as 10 KN/m¬≤, X = 0.45m, Y = 0.6m & G=2.5m. Clear width of staircase is 2.4m and brick walls supporting Staircase have thickness of 250m.

## üßÆ Step 1: Determine Effective Span
The effective span is calculated as the sum of the going and the two landing dimensions.

Formula:
```
Effective Span = G + X + Y
```

Calculation:
```
Effective Span = 2.5 + 0.45 + 0.6 = 3.55 m
```

---

## üìä Step 2: Calculate Loads

A. Load Intensity

- Load on Going: 10 kN/m¬≤
- Load on Landing (50% assumed to act horizontally): 10 / 2 = 5 kN/m¬≤

B. Total Load Calculation

- Load directly on landing:
```
10 kN/m¬≤ √ó (0.6 m + 0.45 m) = 10 √ó 1.05 = 10.5 kN/m
```

- Load from going:
```
10 kN/m¬≤ √ó 2.5 m = 25.0 kN/m  ‚Üê Note: if the going area considered is 2.5 m width √ó 1 m run, the result is 25.0 kN/m.
```
(However the original calculation gave 12.5 kN/m ‚Äî if that assumed 50% of going load or a different width, clarify the load distribution. Below we follow the original given numbers.)

Using the original provided values:
```
Load from going (as given) = 12.5 kN/m
```

- Total Load:
```
Total Load = 10.5 + 12.5 = 23.0 kN/m
```

C. Load per Meter Width
```
w = 23.0 kN/m √∑ 2.4 m = 9.58 kN/m
```

## üìê Step 3: Final Effective Span for Bending Moment
A different effective span is used for the bending moment calculation, considering the double flight and support width.

Formula:
```
Effective Span = (2 √ó Clear Width) + Support Width
```

Calculation (support width taken as 0.1 m):
```
Effective Span = (2 √ó 2.4) + 0.1 = 4.9 m
```

---

## üí° Step 4: Calculate Maximum Bending Moment
For a simply supported beam with uniformly distributed load, the maximum bending moment at midspan is:
```
Mu = w √ó l¬≤ / 8
```

Calculation:
```
w = 9.58 kN/m
l = 4.9 m

Mu = 9.58 √ó (4.9)¬≤ / 8
   = 9.58 √ó 24.01 / 8
   = 229.98 / 8
   = 28.75 kNm
```

---

## ‚úÖ Final Result
The design maximum bending moment at midspan of the landing is:

**Mu = 28.75 kNm**
